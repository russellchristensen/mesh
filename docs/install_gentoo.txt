# git and m2crypto are in portage (watch out for major perl upgrades git likes to pull in!
# if you pull in a new major perl, you will have to recompile tons of things)
emerge -av m2crypto git

# As root, I downloaded zmq and did
./configure
make
make install

# and then downloaded pyzmq 2.0.10 and did (still as root)
python setup.py install

# After installing zmq 2.0.10 from source (and then pyzmq), I had to create a symlink for pyzmq to work:
ln -s /usr/local/lib64/libzmq.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib64/libzmq.so.0

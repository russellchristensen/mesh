          Mesh plugins always live in 
          the present,
          never watch or record 
the past, 
          and never try to anticipate 
                                      the future.
          They always report on what 
          is happening *right now*.

Mesh plugins perform well by striving to be as responsive as possible
   but being as least resource intensive as possible.
Plugins do this by being *interrupt-driven* whenever possible,
   but if we *must* poll, we use these polling-delay guidelines:
      = 1s sleep for polling loops that...
        - don't hit the disk repeatedly
        - finish in < 50ms
        - don't block anything else
        - have no significant resource usage
      = 60s sleep for polling loops that...
        - have light repeated disk access (run a quick program, read a few files)
        - finish in < 1s
        - don't block anything else for > 1s
        - have light resource usage
      = 24h (86400s) sleep for polling loops that...
        - have tons of repeated disk access
        - take a long time
        - have large resource usage

To create a new plugin:
- copy src/p_template.py to a new file starting with 'p_' and ending in '.py'
- follow the instructions inside the plugin template.

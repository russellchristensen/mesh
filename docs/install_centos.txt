# Make CentOS a lot more sane (First, add a repository that has python 2.6 stuff)
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
yum install git patch which swig

# Actually install python 2.6
# NOTE: At the time, comments said 2.6 worked better on CentOS than 2.7 did.
yum install python26 python26-devel

# As root, I downloaded zmq and did
./configure
make
make install

# and then downloaded pyzmq 2.0.10 and did (still as root)
python26 setup.py install

# After installing zmq 2.0.10 from source (and then pyzmq), I had to create a symlink for pyzmq to work:
# NOTE: This is subtly different than it was on Gentoo
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libzmq.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib64/libzmq.so.0

# and then downloaded M2Crypto, untarred, and applied this patch (type the patch line, paste in the rest, push ctrl-d twice)

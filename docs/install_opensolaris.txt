# Here's what I had to do to install mesh on opensolaris

# Install git...I don't remember how I did this, because I installed it a long time ago...

# As root, I downloaded zmq and did
./configure
make
make install

# BEFORE installing pyzmq, you need some symlinks
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libzmq.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/libzmq.so
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libzmq.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/libzmq.so.0
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libzmq.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/libzmq.so.1

# and then downloaded pyzmq 2.0.10 and did (still as root)
python2.6 setup.py install

# install swig
pkg install SUNWswig

# download and install M2Crypto the normal way
python2.6 setup.py install

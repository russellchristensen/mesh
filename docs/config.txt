1. Config Program?
 - Yes, someday.

2. Config "paradigm"?
 - global config + plugin configs, try not to overlap
 - where overlap occurs, plugin value takes precedence
 - where no configured variable is found, hard-coded default in plugin is used

3. Storage format
 - traditional unix-like config format
 - manageable by ConfigParser
 - stored in $ETC/mesh.conf

4. Accessed by calling meshlib.get_config(plugin, variable, default)
